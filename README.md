App Tagline: short one-liner description of your app
https://github.com/Aayush-Agnihotri/HackChallenge
A short description of your app (its purpose and features)
* NSLayoutConstraint used for everything
* There are 5 distinct UITableViews.
* Navigation: When an event is created or edited, there is a push with delegation. When you look at an event's details, it is presented with delegation. You can navigate between
"Public" and "Invites" by tapping the bottom of the screen.
* Integrate with your Backendâ€™s API: The events that show up are from the backend. When an event is created, it is sent to the backend, where it is stored. When an event is edited, it is edited
through the backend. When an event is deleted, it is deleted through the backend. When a private event is accepted or declined, it is accepted or declined through the backend.
